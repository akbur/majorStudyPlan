## Study Plan

This list is a work in progress...

Inspired by [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university) and also including resources from [Machine Learning For Software Engineers](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers).

#### In Progress

I am going to begin focusing on working through the following books next:
* [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 2E - Bryant, O'Hallaron](https://github.com/akbur/studyPlan/blob/master/book-tracking/computer-systems-programmers-perspective.md)
* [Essential System Administration, 3rd Edition: Tools and Techniques for Linux and Unix Administration](https://github.com/akbur/studyPlan/blob/master/book-tracking/essential-sysadmin.md)
